# Loan-Approval-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict loan approvals based on applicant data.
Project Overview
This project implements classification models to predict loan approval status. It includes:
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
✔ Feature Engineering & Selection
✔ Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE
✔ Training Random Forest & Logistic Regression models
✔ Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
✔ Model Evaluation using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
✔ Feature Importance Analysis
✔ Deployment-ready model saved as .pkl

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis & visualization)

Scikit-learn (for ML modeling)

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) (for handling imbalanced data)

Joblib (for saving trained models)
